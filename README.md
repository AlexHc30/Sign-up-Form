# Sign-up-Form
A sign-up form for an imaginary service, created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>

## Features

All fields are required. I created validations for each form field, for password to match confirmation and for the form as a whole. <br> 
If the user clicks the submit button, it checks if inputs and password are valid.<br><br>
If they are not:
  - the submit button is disabled,<br>
  - unfilled inputs border turns to red,<br>
  - error messages are dispayed for unfilled inputs and invalid password.<br>

Inputs and submit button turn to normal as the become valid.<br>
Added pattern format for phone.<br>
